            <p>The Loch Ness Monster, often called “Nessie,” is a legendary creature said to

            <p>The Chupacabra is a modern cryptid born from reports of mysterious livestock
                attacks, described as a vampiric creature that drains animals of their blood. Emerging in the
                1990s across Puerto Rico and the Americas, it has since become a symbol of rural fear,
                unexplained sightings, and the power of rumor to shape monsters.</p>

                humanoid shape. Considered an omen of disaster by some and a misunderstood cryptid by
                others, it remains one of Americas most enduring modern legends.</p>
